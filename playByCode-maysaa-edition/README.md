Computer vs Human game to demonstrate how much computers are faster than humans.

The computer uses a DFS algorithm to get all coins in the game, you should get the coins before the computer does.

Don't worry, we told the computer to have a smaal break between every two steps.

The game is started from the console.

This version has some improvements in it's DFS algorithm, Thanks to Maysaa Alzaro *A fromer ACM ICPC contestant*.
